ðŸ§© Problem Statement: Domino Tiling Problem
You are tasked with finding the number of ways to completely fill a 2 Ã— n grid using 2 Ã— 1 domino tiles. Each tile can be placed either vertically or horizontally.

Goal:
Determine how many ways the grid can be tiled using dominoes.

Input:
An integer n representing the length of the grid.
Output:
An integer representing the number of ways to tile the 2 Ã— n grid.
Constraints:
The grid can be filled by:
Placing one vertical domino in the first column and filling the remaining 2 Ã— (n-1) grid.
Placing two horizontal dominoes to fill the first two rows and covering the remaining 2 Ã— (n-2) grid.

  for i in range(2,n+1):
    ways[i]=ways[i-1]+ways[i-2]    # - ways to fill length (i-1) and place a vertical domino   ways to fill length (i-2) and place two horizontal dominoes
